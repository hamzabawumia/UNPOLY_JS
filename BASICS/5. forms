AJAX FORMS
A form with [up-target] will be submitted via AJAX and leave surrounding elements intact:

<form method="post" action="/users" up-target=".main">
  ...
</form>
A successful submission (status 200) will update .main

A failed submission (non-200 status) will update the form itself
(Or use an [up-fail-target] attribute)
